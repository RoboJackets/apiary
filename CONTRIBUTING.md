## Motivation
This project grew out of frustration with the limitations imposed by Georgia Tech's student organization management system, OrgSync. We found that while it may be an excellent tool for managing small groups, it does not scale very well. To that end, we've tried to design an application that can better support our student organization at its current size, and grow and develop along with our group.

While this is very directly a RoboJackets project, and designed for our specific use case, we've endeavored to make it generic enough for use by any student group at Georgia Tech facing similar challenges at our scale.

## Management
