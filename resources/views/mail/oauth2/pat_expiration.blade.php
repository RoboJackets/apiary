Hi {{ $token->user->preferred_first_name }},

@if($already_expired)
Your {{ config('app.name') }} personal access token called "{{ $token->name }}" expired on {{ $token->expires_at }} and is no longer valid.
@else
Your {{ config('app.name') }} personal access token called "{{ $token->name }}" will expire on {{ $token->expires_at }} and will not work after that time.
@endif

Token expiration dates cannot be extended. If you're still using this token, you must create a new token to continue accessing the {{ config('app.name') }} API. You can create a new token by accessing your user page in the {{ config('app.name') }} admin interface and running the "Create Personal Access Token" action.

If you need any assistance, please ask in #it-helpdesk in Slack.
