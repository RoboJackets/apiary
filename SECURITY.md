# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are primarily concerned with versions that are deployed to a live environment. In general, any deployment will be running the latest version of the code within one week of it being pushed to GitHub.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Any security issues with the Apiary code or any RoboJackets-managed Apiary deployment (*.robojackets.org) should be reported to apiary@robojackets.org.
This will notify our development and operations teams and you should receive a response within 8 business hours Eastern Time.
