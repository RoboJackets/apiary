# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are primarily concerned with versions that are deployed to a live environment.
You can see which commits are live in each environment on [the deployments page](https://github.com/RoboJackets/apiary/deployments).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Any security issues with the Apiary code or any RoboJackets-managed Apiary deployment (*.robojackets.org) should be reported to apiary@robojackets.org.
This will notify our development and operations teams and you should receive a response within 8 business hours Eastern Time.
