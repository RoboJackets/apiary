Merchandise
===========

RoboJackets members who pay dues are eligible to receive merchandise, such as a t-shirt or polo.
When you physically give someone merchandise, you must record it in Apiary.

When a student pays for a dues package that is restricted to students (rather than a non-student package), they are offered a choice of merchandise attached to the package.

.. hint::
   To reccord distribution or view transactions, you must have an :ref:`officer`, :ref:`project-manager`, or :ref:`team-lead` role.
   If you need access, ask in :slack:`it-helpdesk`.

#. Scroll to the :guilabel:`Dues Transactions` heading, and select the transaction for which you want to distribute merchandise.

Recording Merchandise Distribution
----------------------------------

To record distribution of an item, follow these steps.

#. Open the details page for the merchandise item you want to distribute.
   You can either use the steps in the section above, or look at the :guilabel:`Merchandise` list under the :guilabel:`Dues` heading in the left sidebar.
#. Click the Actions menu (three dots |actionsmenu|) to the right of the :guilabel:`Merchandise Details` header, then select the :guilabel:`Distribute Merchandise` option.
#. Search for the user you're distributing merchandise to, then click :guilabel:`Mark as Picked Up`.
   If you do not see the user's name in the list, they may not be eligible to receive the item, or they may not have selected it when they paid dues.
   You can ask in :slack:`it-helpdesk` if you're not sure.
