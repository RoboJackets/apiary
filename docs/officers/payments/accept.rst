Recording an offline payment
----------------------------

To record a cash payment, check, or waiver, follow the steps below.

.. vale Google.Will = NO

#. From the Apiary homepage, click the :guilabel:`Admin` link in the top navigation bar.
#. Under the :guilabel:`Other` header in the left sidebar, click :guilabel:`Users`.
#. Search for the member using the search box under the :guilabel:`Users` header, then select the user from the results.
#. To record a payment for dues, scroll to the :guilabel:`Dues Transactions` heading.
   To record a payment for travel, scroll to the :guilabel:`Travel Assignments` heading.
#. Select an existing dues transaction or travel assignment from the list.
   **Don't click** :guilabel:`Create Dues Transaction` or :guilabel:`Create Travel Assignment`.

   .. vale Google.Parens = NO

   #. If the member doesn't have an existing **dues transaction** for the dues package they want to pay for, they need to update their selected dues package (labeled :guilabel:`Dues Term`) in the member-facing UI.
   #. If the member doesn't have an existing **travel assignment** for the travel they want to pay for, the primary contact for the travel must create the assignment.

#. Click the Actions menu (three dots |actionsmenu|) to the right of the :guilabel:`Travel Assignment Details` or :guilabel:`Dues Transaction Details` header, then choose the option for the payment method you want to record.
#. Depending on the payment method, you will see a popup to provide information about the payment.
#. When you're done, click the blue button at the bottom of the popup to record the payment.
#. For cash and check payments, Apiary will send a receipt to the member's Georgia Tech email address.
   Waivers don't trigger receipts, as they're not actual payments.
