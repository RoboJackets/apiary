Accepting Payments
==================

While most members choose to pay online, cash and checks need to be recorded in Apiary manually by an officer or project manager.
Treasurers also have the ability to apply waivers.

.. hint::
   To record cash or check payments, you must have a project manager or officer role.
   To apply waivers, you need a separate permission.
   If you need access, ask in :slack:`it-helpdesk`.

Recording an Offline Payment
----------------------------

To record a cash payment, check, or waiver, follow the steps below.

#. From the Apiary homepage, click the :guilabel:`Admin` link in the top navigation bar.
#. Under the :guilabel:`Other` header in the left sidebar, click :guilabel:`Users`.
#. Search for the member using the search box under the :guilabel:`Users` header, then select the user from the results.
#. To record a payment for dues, scroll to the :guilabel:`Dues Transactions` heading.
   To record a payment for travel, scroll to the :guilabel:`Travel Assignments` heading.
#. Select an existing dues transaction or travel assignment from the list.
   **Do not click** :guilabel:`Create Dues Transaction` or :guilabel:`Create Travel Assignment`.

   #. If the member does not have an existing **dues transaction** for the dues package they want to pay for, they need to update their selected dues package (labeled :guilabel:`Dues Term`) in the member-facing UI.
   #. If the member does not have an existing **travel assignment** for the travel they want to pay for, the primary contact for the travel must create the assignment.

#. Click the Actions menu (three dots |actionsmenu|) to the right of the :guilabel:`Travel Assignment Details` or :guilabel:`Dues Transaction Details` header, then choose the option for the payment method you want to record.
#. Depending on the payment method, you will see a popup to provide additional information about the payment.
#. When you're done, click the blue button at the bottom of the popup to record the payment.
#. For cash and check payments, a receipt will be sent to the member's Georgia Tech email address.
   Waivers do not receive receipts, as no funds change hands.
