:og:description: Apiary supports granular access control to different functions of the software.

Permissions and Roles
=====================

Apiary supports granular access control to limit access to the software.
Most actions require a specific permission, and permissions are grouped into roles.
Users can be assigned any combination of roles and permissions, and their effective access is cumulative across all assigned roles and permissions.

Role Descriptions
-----------------

Roles provide a quick and easy way to assign a group of permissions to a user.

.. warning::
   For service accounts using the :doc:`/admins/api/index`, assign specific permissions rather than a role.

.. _admin:

``admin``
~~~~~~~~~
This role grants access to almost all functions and should only be assigned to system administrators, developers, and other technical users. Some functions check for an associated ``admin`` role rather than a specific permission.

.. _officer:

``officer``
~~~~~~~~~~~

- View users, :ref:`dues transactions <Dues Transaction>`, and :doc:`payments </officers/payments/index>`
- Create and update :ref:`dues packages <Dues Package>`
- Create and update events
- :doc:`Take attendance for any team or event </officers/attendance>`
- :ref:`Record cash, check, or waiver payments <Recording an Offline Payment>`
- :ref:`Distribute merchandise <Recording Merchandise Distribution>`
- Manage travel

.. _project-manager:

``project-manager``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- View users, :ref:`dues transactions <Dues Transaction>`, and :doc:`payments </officers/payments/index>`
- :doc:`Take attendance for any team or event </officers/attendance>`
- :ref:`Record cash or check payments <Recording an Offline Payment>`
- :ref:`Distribute merchandise <Recording Merchandise Distribution>`
- Manage travel

.. _team-lead:

``team-lead``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- View users, :ref:`dues transactions <Dues Transaction>`, and :doc:`payments </officers/payments/index>`
- :doc:`Take attendance for any team or event </officers/attendance>`
- :ref:`Distribute merchandise <Recording Merchandise Distribution>`

.. _trainer:

``trainer``
~~~~~~~~~~~

- View users
- :doc:`Take attendance for any team or event </officers/attendance>`

``member`` and ``non-member``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These are identical roles that provide baseline access to end users. They are assigned automatically based on user behavior and should not be manually attached or detached.

Special Permissions
-------------------

The following permissions are not included with any roles, and must be manually assigned to a user if necessary.

.. _refund-payments:

``refund-payments``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most payments are considered non-refundable. If an exception is made, this permission should be attached to the treasurer or other financial officer. This enables the :doc:`Refund Payments action </officers/payments/refund>`.

``impersonate-users``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This permission enables `impersonation within Laravel Nova <https://nova.laravel.com/docs/4.0/customization/impersonation.html>`__. It should only be attached to developers while debugging an issue.

``authenticate-with-docusign``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This permission enables a convenience URL (``/sign/auth``) to configure `DocuSign impersonation <https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/>`__. It should only be attached to system administrators that are configuring DocuSign.
