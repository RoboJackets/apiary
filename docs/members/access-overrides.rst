Access overrides
================

As a new RoboJackets member, you can request temporary access to RoboJackets services, such as GitHub and Google Drive, before paying dues.

.. vale write-good.E-Prime = NO

If you're eligible for a self-service access override, you'll see a card on your Apiary dashboard labeled :guilabel:`New Member Access`.
This card explains how the override works and what you need to do to request the override.

.. vale write-good.TooWordy = NO
.. vale write-good.Weasel = NO

In general, you may request a self-service access override if you have:

- Never paid RoboJackets dues
- Never previously received an access override, including expired overrides
- Signed the RoboJackets membership agreement
- Attended a RoboJackets team meeting, and an officer recorded your attendance within Apiary

Once you have completed all required tasks, click :guilabel:`Request Access` on the :guilabel:`New Member Access` card.

If you run into any issues, please ask in :slack:`it-helpdesk`.

.. note::
   If you aren't eligible for a self-service access override, the card won't appear on your dashboard. Please ask in :slack:`it-helpdesk` for a manual override.
