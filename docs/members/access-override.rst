Access Override
===============

As a new RoboJackets member, you can request temporary access to RoboJackets services without paying dues.

If you're eligible for a self-service access override, you'll see a card on your MyRoboJackets dashboard labeled **New Member Access**.
This card explains how the override works and what you need to do to request the override.

In general, you may request a self-service access override if you have:

- Never paid RoboJackets dues
- Never previously received an access override, including expired overrides
- Signed the RoboJackets membership agreement
- Attended a RoboJackets team meeting, and your attendance was recorded within MyRoboJackets

Once you have completed all required tasks, click **Request Access** on the **New Member Access** card.

If you run into any issues, please ask in :slack:`it-helpdesk`.

.. note::
   If you're not eligible for a self-service access override, the card will not appear on your dashboard. Please ask in :slack:`it-helpdesk` for assistance.
